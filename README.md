Catala is a domain-specific language for deriving
faithful-by-construction algorithms from legislative texts. This is not the main repository of Catala but a formalization of it's semantics in coq.
You can find the main repository on [github](https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala).

## Concepts

Catala is a programming language adapted for socio-fiscal legislative literate
programming. By annotating each line of the legislative text with its meaning
in terms of code, one can derive an implementation of complex socio-fiscal
mechanisms that enjoys a high level of assurance regarding the code-law
faithfulness.


## Building and installation

**This is not the main catala repository. If you are searching for the catala compiler, please look [here](https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala).**

To start developing, you first need to install opam. Then you can run the following commands:

  opam switch create coq-catala 4.14.0
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  eval $(opam env --switch=coq-catala --set-switch)
  opam repository add coq-released --all-switches
  opam install . --deps-only

Once it is done, you can use dune to build the part of the project that build

    dune build

And start your favorite interactive proof interface for coq.


## Limitations and disclaimer

This formalization is based on previous work by Fran√ßois Pottier,
available here [MRPI-2.4](https://gitlab.inria.fr/fpottier/mpri-2.4-public/-/blob/master/coq/). Namely, some tactics as well as the `Autosubst_EOS.v`, `Autosubst_FreeVars.v` and `AutosubstExtra.v` files.

Some lemma statements were took on previous projects by [Evelyne Contejean](https://www.lri.fr/~contejea/).

Catala is a research project from Inria, the French National
Research Institute for Computer Science.
