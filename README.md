## File detailed description.

The file `sequences.v` is adapted from previous work by Fran√ßois Pottier itself taken on previous work by Xavier Leroy with additions by the authors of this artifact.

## Building and installation


To start developing, you first need to install opam. Then you can run the following commands:

    opam switch create rcoq-catala 4.14.0
    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    eval $(opam env --switch=rcoq-catala --set-switch)
    opam repository add rcoq-released --all-switches
    opam install . --deps-only

Once it is done, you can use dune to build the Rcoq development

    dune build

And start your favorite interactive proof interface for Rcoq.
