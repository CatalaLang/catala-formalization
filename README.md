# Artifact for "Scaling Up Mechanized Proof Automation for Small-step Semantics"

This is the companion artifact to the paper "Scaling Up Mechanized Proof Automation for Small-step Semantics".

This artifact contains the Rocq code described in the paper.


## Detailed File Description

The file `CLAIMS.md` links statements made in the paper with this artifact.

The file `sequences.v` is adapted from previous work by Fran√ßois Pottier, which was based on work by Xavier Leroy, with a few additions by the authors of this artifact.

## Hardware Dependencies    

Minimal dependencies are required. The entire proof builds in 1 minute on a recent laptop.


## Building and Installation

To start developing, you first need to install `opam` using your package manager. According to [https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html], you can run the following commands:

    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)"
    opam init

Then, you can execute the following commands to install the artifact dependencies (including Rocq):

    opam switch create rocq-catala 4.14.0
    opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    eval $(opam env --switch=rocq-catala --set-switch)
    opam repository add rocq-released --all-switches
    opam install . --deps-only


## Step-by-Step Instructions

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use Dune to build the `Rcoq` development:

    dune build

Then, start your favorite interactive proof interface for `Rcoq`.
